# Summary of what we did in the first week  

This document provides a summary of what we covered during the first class.

### Key Sections:

1. **Part 1** – Programming Paradigms Overview

We reviewed the fundamental concepts in software development and the main programming paradigms:

- Procedural and functional programming (e.g., C)

- Object-oriented programming (e.g., Java)

- Multiparadigm programming (e.g., C++, Python, JavaScript)

2. **Part 2** – New Languages for Data Science and AI

We explored modern programming languages used in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, such as Mojo and Julia. These languages compile code while using Python's syntax and ecosystem.

3. **Part 3** – Classification of Programming Languages

We categorized programming languages into two main types:

- Compiled languages (e.g., Julia, Mojo, Java)

- Interpreted languages (e.g., Python)

4. **Part 4** – How to Conduct a Literature Review

We learned that reading three or more scientific articles on the same topic and extracting the problematic, approach, and perspectives from each one allows you to build a structured review. This is especially effective when the articles address the same problem using different approaches.

5. **Part 5** – Introduction to Scientific Computing with Python

Finally, we discussed the topic of scientific computing with Python and what we will be learning throughout this module with the professor.
